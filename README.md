# Prompt Enhancer :speech_balloon:

Welcome to the repository for the Prompt Enhancer, a Streamlit web application designed to enhance your interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 Turbo by OpenAI.

## Overview :open_book:

Prompt Enhancer takes a user input (a prompt intended for a language model) and refines it to generate optimal results. The user can then select an enhanced prompt for re-inputting into an LLM, thus increasing the efficiency of their interaction with the LLM.

## Features :bulb:

- **Prompt enhancement:** Improves the prompt you're intending to input to LLMs.
- **Multiple suggestions:** Offers three differently worded prompts based on your original input.
- **Explanation for each prompt:** Provides reasoning for each suggestion to help understand how it improves upon the original.

## Tech Stack :wrench:

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): Open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/): Powers the app with language model GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/): A library to develop and manage prompt engineering techniques for Language Learning Models (LLMs).
